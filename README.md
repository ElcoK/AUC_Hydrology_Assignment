# Hydrology and Watershed Management: Flood Risk Tutorial

The  purpose  of  the  assignments  is  that  students  learn  to  apply  the  methods  for  assessing  flood risk,  and  learn  how  to  interpret  the  results  of these analyses.

The assignment should be made individually.

# How to get the assignments up and running:

Go the repository on Binder:  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ElcoK/AUC_Hydrology_Assignment/master)

Or download this repository and install a virtual environment. Recommended option is to use a [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
environment to work in for this project, relying on conda to handle some of the
trickier library dependencies:

```bash

# Add conda-forge channel for extra packages
conda config --add channels conda-forge

# Create a conda environment for the project and install packages
conda env create -f environment.yml
activate AUC_Hydro

```
